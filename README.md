Project Overview:
The Realtorspk project is a comprehensive real estate platform designed to assist users in discovering and acquiring various types of properties including commercial spaces, residential properties, and shared roof sites. It serves as a one-stop solution for individuals and businesses seeking properties for rent, sale, or lease.

Technological Stack:

Cypress Automation Tools: Cypress is a modern testing framework built for the web. It provides an end-to-end testing solution that includes an easy-to-use interface, robust testing capabilities, and excellent support for JavaScript.
JavaScript: JavaScript is the primary programming language used for scripting test cases in Cypress. It offers flexibility and versatility, making it suitable for implementing complex test scenarios.
Page Object Model (POM): The testing framework follows the Page Object Model design pattern, which enhances test script maintainability and reusability. In POM, each web page is represented by a corresponding page object, encapsulating the page's elements and actions.
Customized Structure:
The project's testing framework is tailored to meet industry standards and workflows, accommodating different paths for testing various functionalities. This customized structure ensures that the testing process aligns with the specific requirements and practices of the real estate domain.

Features:

Property Types: The platform caters to diverse property types including commercial spaces, residential properties, and shared roof sites. Test scenarios are designed to verify the functionality related to each property type, ensuring a seamless user experience across all categories.

End-to-End Testing: Cypress Automation Tools are utilized for end-to-end testing, covering the entire user journey from logging in to searching for properties and performing various interactions on the platform. This comprehensive testing approach helps identify and rectify potential issues at different stages of the user flow.

Positive and Negative Testing: The test suite includes both positive and negative test cases to validate the system's behavior under different conditions. Positive tests confirm expected functionality, while negative tests simulate erroneous inputs or unexpected behavior to ensure proper error handling and system robustness.

Page Object Model (POM): The testing framework is structured following the Page Object Model design pattern, which enhances test script organization and maintenance. Each page of the application has a corresponding page object containing methods and properties to interact with the page's elements, promoting code reusability and readability.

Conclusion:
The Realtorspk project's testing framework, powered by Cypress Automation Tools and JavaScript, is structured to efficiently validate the platform's functionalities while adhering to industry standards and best practices. Through end-to-end testing and the utilization of the Page Object Model design pattern, the framework ensures thorough validation of the real estate platform's features, enhancing its reliability and user satisfaction.
